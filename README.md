# ChannelAdvisor
A python wrapper for the channel advisor api.
I've been writing and testing the api in python2.7 but I learned python3 first, so it may very well work in python 3.

Dependencies
    suds, beautifulsoup
    
Basic usage
- Create a "data.cookie" file
- Inside, write "devkey <devkey>" replace <devkey> with your channeladvisor developer key
- run the main() function
'''python
import channelAdvisor
main()
'''
